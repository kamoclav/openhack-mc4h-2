# Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack

This section of the OpenHack is designed to be more self guided than earlier sections. It will take a little more time to accomplish each task and there will often be more than one way to be successful. Take time to explore the tools and make the challenges your own!

## Analytics Introduction

Data analytics are fundamental to a wide range of disciplines in the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) industry, including clinical trials, medical research, population health, clinical ML model development, 'omics (genomics, metagenomics, etc.), healthcare quality improvement studies, and more. The topics we touch on in this OpenHack related to data analytics include FHIR bulk export and anonymization (de-identification of PHI).

## Who is the Analytics section of the OpenHack for?
Anyone interested in learning more about how they can ask meaningful questions of their FHIR data

## What will you learn?

The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack offers an opportunity to **explore the analytic tools in the MC4H ecosystem**. Hands on challenges will guide you through asking questions of the FHIR dataset, statistical analysis, and data visualization. You will gain insights and explore **how to share those insights** with your organization and partner organizations.

Working with Healthcare data for analytics requires **proper handling of PHI and respect for patient privacy**. This hack provides a roadmap for anonymizing datasets and securely sharing data with partner groups.

Let's explore some data!
